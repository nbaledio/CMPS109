Notes:
-I did not do pair programming
-I was unable to include error messages for every case. For the most part, the program
will assume inputs are formatted correctly
-Object numbers on polygons may not be perfectly centered, but they are centered more or less
-Object number is printed in black, so if an object is black it will simply blend in
-Object number for text is put below text so it doesn't overlap
