- I did not do pair programming for this assignment
- Tokenize code used from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tokenizing-a-string-cpp/
- istream reader code used from http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/istream/istream/read/
- Error messages are printed to stderr, not log. Server (cixd) will still have some log
messages (not sure if server was also supposed to only print error messages)
