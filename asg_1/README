Notes:
- I did not do pair programming for this assignment
- I added a new function "append()" to ubigint so it could format
correctly in the udivide function
- I slightly modified the libfns.cpp file so that the static 
bigints declared there would be created with the proper format
-Multiplication formula was derived from asg1-dc-bigint.pdf
-Division by two formula was derived from 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_by_two
- I modified the formula for trimming zeros provided in the pdf
as the formula would pop results of "0" and return and empty
ubigint. Formula now has condition of size > 1
